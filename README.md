# PitchPerfect
In progress. This iOS application allows the user to record his or her voice in a microphone. The recording can then be played back with a different pitch or frequency for a deep, high, slow, or fast voice. The pause and play, and play back buttons also allow you to stop and switch between variations.â€‹
